# python_vote_bot_attempt
I tried to make a vote bot for google forms that would click on something as many times as possible

This was just made for selecting the 6th thing in a list of multiple choice options on a google form.
Quick and dirty just doing it for a friend. You'll also need chromewebdriver in the same directory which you cnan get here: https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.37/
